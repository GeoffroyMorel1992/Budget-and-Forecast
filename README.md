# Budget and Forecasting
The budget will be compared to the forecast to analyze and assess the financial developments.

## Budget:
It is a detailed estimation of planned revenues and expenses over a fixed period, providing a financial roadmap.

## Forecast:
It is a frequently updated projection of financial expectations, regularly adjusted to reflect changes in the environment, enabling more flexible and responsive planning.

## Difference between Budget and forecast
While the budget remains static, the forecast adapts to economic and operational shifts.

# Forecasting Tools and Methods
We will employ Python and machine learning to analyze financial trends based on historical data and optimize budgets through an optimal allocation system of resources.

The machine learning methods to be utilized include:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forests
- SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
- XGBoost
